### [Simplicity and Usability]

<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->

[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
The system must be simple, intuitive, and immediately usable without training.

Clean and minimal user interfaces

Attendance marking completed in seconds

Fully usable on both desktop and mobile devices

### [Speed and Performance]

<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->

[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
The system must provide fast response times, especially during QR Code attendance.

Near-instant QR Code scanning and validation

Optimized server-side processing and database access

No user action should depend on long or blocking operation

### [Simple and Maintainable Architecture]

<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->

[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
The project architecture must remain intentionally simple and easy to understand.

Use of an MVC architecture

Clear separation of concerns (Model, View, Controller)

Preference for stable and proven technologies

### [Data Integrity and Persistence]

[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
Security and personal data protection are non-negotiable.

Full compliance with GDPR

Secure access control (authentication and authorization)

Confidentiality of personal data

Fraud prevention mechanisms:

One-time attendance per user

Time-limited QR Code validity

## [Functional and Non-Functional Constraints]

<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
Fast and reliable QR Code attendance

Usable on both desktop and mobile platforms

Consistently fast response times

Full traceability of actions (who, when, what)

Collection of personal data limited to what is strictly necessary

## [Development Workflow and Quality Standards]

<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
All features must comply with simplicity, performance, and security principles

Changes must never compromise:

Attendance speed

Data protection and GDPR compliance

Tests must cover:

Attendance scenarios

Fraud attempts

Unauthorized access

## Governance

<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
This constitution supersedes all other technical and functional decisions

Any amendment must:
